        <h1><b>What is thrifting ?</b></h1>
        <img src="images/thrift.jpg" style="width: 550px; border-radius: 20px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        </center>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">So, what is thrift culture and why is thrifting so popular all of a sudden? 
            In short, thrifting translates to purchasing items (usually clothing, accessories, 
            or fashion items) that are either pre-used, discarded as surplus by fast fashion brands 
            or even old items that are upcycled/repurposed and sold by thrift stores. </p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;">A lot of people seem to be indulging in thrift culture simply because they get their favourite 
            branded clothes for off-brand prices, but is there more to thrifting than cheap purchases? Well, 
            yes! Those jeans you bought for cheap off a thrift store instead of directly from a fast fashion brand, 
            are not only gentle on your purse but also on the environment. </p>

        </center>
        <h2><b>Fast fashion and its effects on the environment</b></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">To understand why thrifting, the alternative to buying firsthand, is good, we must first take 
        a look at how purchasing from global fast fashion brands can be harmful. </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Here are a few ways in which the fashion industry is causing harm to the environment: 
            The fashion industry is responsible for 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions which approximates 1.2 billion tonnes of greenhouse gasses released yearly.            
            It can take up to 10,000 litres of water to produce one pair of jeans            
            Fast fashion items are often produced in factories in developing countries like Bangladesh, China, India and Vietnam, with cheap labour and little to no enforcement of ethical labour laws which results in horrendous working conditions and even forced child labour at times.             
            85% of all textiles are wasted every year and end up in dumps, they are also a major cause of microplastic pollution in our water bodies as simply washing clothes can release 500,000 tonnes of microfibers every year. </p>

        </center>
        <h2><b>The possible downside</b></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Like most things in life, even thrift culture can have a downside, the first one being over-purchasing. With a plethora of cheap options and so many stores to choose from, it is easy to get carried away and end up purchasing cheap quality items that are worn once and later discarded as waste. 
            Secondly, the demand for branded goods gives incentives to producers of first-copy goods. Which are basically fakes that look identical to branded items. Many thrift stores, knowingly or unknowingly sell fakes to satiate the customer’s demand for cheap, branded items. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, thrifting does not change the fact that the clothes in circulation still come from fast-fashion brands that use unsustainable, resource-intensive and unethical methods of production. Hence, while thrifting does increase the life cycle of these garments, it does not fully address the 
        environmental and social issues regarding the production of these items. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The best way to tackle this would be to avoid over-purchasing and be conscious of the goods you do purchase. In the words of Lauren Singer, founder of Package Free Shop and Trash is for tossers, ‘love secondhand shopping but ensure that you invest in timeless, high-quality pieces that you 
            will value for the rest of your life.’</p>

        <h2><b>Thrifting in India and its benefits !</b></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Thrifting in India has taken up a whole new space and identity, which might be different from how it’s done in the rest of the world. 
            In many countries, like the US, thrifting thrives on the existence of brick-and-mortar thrift stores where you have to physically go 
            and purchase items. However, in India, 90% of the thrifting industry thrives online through Instagram accounts and websites. This means 
            that they source the products for you, so you don’t have to scavenge for them yourselves.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In India, Gen Z, being the more eco-conscious and environmentally woke generation, seems to be the backbone of the thrifting industry, 
            and has constantly propagated thrift culture. Therefore, most of these online thrift stores are also run by Gen Z and millennials. 
            Here is how thrifting can be beneficial: </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The best way to tackle this would be to avoid over-purchasing and be conscious of the goods you do purchase. In the words of Lauren Singer, founder of Package Free Shop and Trash is for tossers, ‘love secondhand shopping but ensure that you invest in timeless, 
            high-quality pieces that you will value for the rest of your life.’</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Thrifting, for one, seems to be the cheaper alternative than purchasing firsthand from sustainable and ethical brands, like no nasties, seams friendly, Goodearth etc since most of these brands come with a heavy price tag. This is also why thrift culture is 
            seen as highly attractive to the younger generation as compared to the rest. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">For many buyers, the sheer convenience of thrifting in India is a big bonus. Ishani Sharma, 27 and an avid thrifter, tells us how she enjoys the 
            thrifting experience since with the existence of hundreds of online thrift stores, she can simply purchase her desired product from the comfort 
            of her own home. The shipping takes no longer than a week and thrift store owners clean, sanitize and often personalise each package and leave a 
            darling note inside!</p>

            <h2><b>People Have Been Reusing Clothes Forever But</b></h2>
            <h2><b>Thrift Shops Are Relatively New. Here's Why</b></h2>
            <img src="images/stores.webp" style="width: 550px; border-radius: 20px; margin-top: 20px;">

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Friday is National Thrift Store Day, and secondhand stores nationwide will be offering 
            deals to encourage people to give back by shopping. But while people have been repurposing worn-out clothing for as 
            long as clothes have existed, thrift stores are a relatively new invention in American history.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In an earlier era nothing went to waste. “If you had a dress and it got worn out, you’d
             tear it up and make a pinafore for your daughter, and when that got trashed, you’d tear it up and stuff your chair 
             with it,” explains historian Jennifer Le Zotte, author of From Goodwill to Grunge: A History of Secondhand Styles 
             and Alternative Economies.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">That changed in the late 19th century, for a number of reasons. For one thing, cities grew 
            rapidly—partly because of the historical surge in new arrivals during America’s biggest wave of immigration. The industrial 
            revolution introduced the mass-production of clothing, changing the game. The more affordable it became to buy new clothes, 
            the more people thought of clothes as disposable. Le Zotte points out that as urban populations grew, the size of living spaces 
            shrunk, and more possessions were being thrown away. In addition to improved waste management systems, pawnshops and scrap materials 
            sprung up during this period in an effort to find new uses for these items.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">When you shop at a thrift store, it’s exciting to think about what you might find. 
            The thrill of the hunt is what compels most people to shop at a thrift store. Most thrift store shoppers are also creative people. 
            They’re able to think outside the box to envision new life for a gently used item. For example, clothing at a thrift store isn’t necessarily 
            in-season, but those who buy clothes at a thrift store are able to get creative to express their own personal style in a way that is relevant 
            to what’s in-season.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Most thrift store shoppers can get lost in the aisles of a thrift store. The aisles of old books. 
            Clothing racks with vintage designer finds. Board games that aren’t sold anywhere else anymore. There’s so much to sift through. 
            A thrift store is also a great place to find collectible items, valuable jewelry, and items that you literally can’t find anywhere else.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">When you’re shopping at Goodwill, you never know what you’ll find. You might walk into a thrift store wanting to 
            look for clothes and leave with a pile of books or a piece of art. If you love the thrill of finding something completely unexpected and unique, 
            then you’ll love shopping at a thrift store.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike retail stores that typically have dedicated inventory delivery and stocking days, thrift 
            stores that rely on donations don’t. Thrift stores accept donations any day at any time. Plus, the staff works around the clock 
            to get those donations out on the shelves as quickly as possible. With that being said, there’s really not a specific day that’s 
            best to go to a thrift store. However, if you want to be a strategic thrift store shopper, the trick is to go often. Because thrift 
            stores are constantly selling and restocking, you could shop on a Monday and a Friday of the same week and find a completely different 
            inventory.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Most thrift store shoppers tend to do quick runs every so often when they’re feeling inspired to go on a hunt 
            for unique finds. One day you might not find anything that speaks to you and another day you might leave with bags of stuff.</p>

            <img src="images/going.jpg" style="width: 350px; border-radius: 20px; margin-top: 20px;">
            </center>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Thrift shopping is not only a fun way to find unique finds, but it’s also a way to give back 
                to the community. Goodwill’s mission is to end poverty through the power of work. By shopping at or donating to Goodwill, 
                you’re helping Goodwill provide no-cost career services to the community. Essentially, a clothing or household donation to 
                Goodwill helps fight unemployment in our community. It’s nice to know that when you’re shopping, you’re also helping place 
                Arizonans in jobs.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re thinking about donating your gently used items to Goodwill, it’s a great way to 
                give back even if you don’t want to shop there. Just by donating your items, you’re helping to keep the shelves stocked so 
                people can purchase those items at a discounted price.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Donating to your local Goodwill has never been easier. Thanks to your donations and your goodwill,
                 you help individuals achieve self-sufficiency when they land a job thanks to the no-cost services from Goodwill. This helps 
                 Goodwill carry on its mission of ending poverty through the power of work. Goodwill never turns down donations and will happily 
                 sort and sell just about anything.</p>
